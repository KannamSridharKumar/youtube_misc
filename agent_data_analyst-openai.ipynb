    "Let's say I want to analyze the data from the [Kaggle Titanic challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) in order to predict the survival of individual passengers. But before digging into this myself, I want an autonomous agent to prepare the analysis for me by extracting trends and plotting some figures to find insights.\n",
